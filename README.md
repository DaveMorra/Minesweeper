# Minesweeper
## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. The goal is to uncover all the tiles on the grid without hitting a mine. The game provides a grid where each cell can either be a mine or a number that represents the count of neighboring mines. Uncover all 381 safe cells to win the game, but be careful not to hit a mine!

## How to Build and Run
To build and run the Minesweeper game on a linux system that can use qmake build system, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Use a linux system
- Have CMake and QMake installed on your system
- If using a server, besure to use Xquartz and enable X11, to forward the graphics to your machine.

### To Build
- Might be able to run ./My Project right away because I have already included necessary build files.
- Otherwise, to re-build the project, run:
```
qmake6 asign1.pro
make
```
- To run the program:
```
./MyProject
```
